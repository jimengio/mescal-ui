## Mescal UI

### Usage

```bash
npm install @jimengio/mescal-ui
```

```ts
import "antd-mobile/dist/antd-mobile.css";
```

Also you are supposed to have styles for the components:

```css
body * {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  flex-shrink: 0;
}
```

### Develop

Folders:

- `src/` for components
- `example/` for develop UI

when add a new component, add in `src/` and provide a demo in example pages.
